Hi there!

My name is Jacek Dargiel. I'm a JavaScript Developer from Warsaw, Poland. I work for [10Clouds](https://10clouds.com) - a major polish software house focused on web, mobile and design. I&nbsp;have five years of commercial Front-end Development experience, with some non-commercial projects earlier. *I&nbsp;will not pretend to be an expert in anything.* I&nbsp;do however **love to learn and consume knowledge**. I'm an enthusiast of shiny new technologies. Sometimes an evangelist even. I&nbsp;work with HTML5, CSS3, JS Web APIs, and more high-level frameworks like Angular and React.

This blog is my playground. You can read my thoughts on the technical aspects of the projects I&nbsp;work on at the moment, technologies I&nbsp;choose, and why. If you like what you read here, please subscribe to my [feed](/atom.xml "The blog's Atom feed") and share links with your friends and co-workers.

Oh, and find me on Front-end conferences in Warsaw and around Poland.

Have a splendid day!
